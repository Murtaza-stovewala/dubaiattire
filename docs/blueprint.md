- Primary color: Royal Blue (#0D1B2A) to convey luxury and sophistication.
- Background color: Very light grayish blue (#F0F4F8), almost white, echoing the primary color's hue but with very low saturation, for a clean backdrop that complements the richer hues.
- Accent color: Gold (#CFA15B) as a secondary color for highlights and calls to action, reinforcing the premium feel.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif with geometric lines for a high-end, fashionable feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for readability and a modern look. 
- Use elegant, custom icons with a gold or royal blue fill to match the overall aesthetic.
- Implement subtle animations, such as fade-ins and smooth transitions, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
